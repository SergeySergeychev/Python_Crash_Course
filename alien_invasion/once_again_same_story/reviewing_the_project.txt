Reviewing the Project.

    1. Examine our code and determine if we need to refactor before
    implementing new features.
    2. Add a single alien to the top-left corner of the screen with
    appropriate spacing around it.
    3. Use the spacing around the first alien and the overall screen
    size to determine how many aliens can fit on the screen. We'll
    write a loop to create aliens to fill the upper portion of the
    screen.
    4. Make the fleet move sideways and down until the entire fleet
    is shot down, an alien hits the ship, or an alien reaches the
    ground. IF the whole fleet is shot down, we'll create a new fleet.
    If an alien hits the ship or the ground, we'll destroy the ship
    and create a new fleet.
    5. Limit the number of ships the player can use, and end the game
    when player has used up the allotment of ships.
