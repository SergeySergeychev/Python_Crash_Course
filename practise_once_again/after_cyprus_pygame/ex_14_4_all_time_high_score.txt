Ex. 14-4, page Nr.317.
    # Description :
        # The high score is reset every time a player closes and restarts
        Alien Invasion. Fix this by writing the high score to a file before
        calling sys.exit() adn reading the high score in when initializing its
        value in GameStats.

        # Solution:
            # Create txt file with name high_score.txt
            # Create filename(high_score.txt) in game_stats.
            # Create function read file high_score:
                # Read file
            # Create function write to file high_score:
                # Write to file high_score


and make the number in file be equal to prep_high
