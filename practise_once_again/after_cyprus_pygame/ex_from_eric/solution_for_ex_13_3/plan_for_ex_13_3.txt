    Exercise:
                Find an image of a raindrop and create a grid of raindrops.
            Make the raindrops fall toward the bottom of the screen until
            they disappear.

    Working plan:

# Write class settings for screen and raindrop.
    # In class setting Initialize the game's setting.
    # Write screen settings such as screen_width, screen_height, bg_color.
    # Write raindrop settings such as raindrops_speed_factors

# Write class raindrop.
    # First of all use instruments  as pygame and Sprite.
    # Raindrop class inherits from Sprite class.
    # Class Raindrop present a single raindrop.
    # Initialize the raindrop and set it starting position.
        # Load raindrops image and set its rectangle attribute.
        # Start each new raindrop near the top left of the screen.
        # Store raindrops exact position.
    # Write function blitme.
        # Draw the alien at its current location


# Write game_functionality.

    # Use instruments as sys, pygame.
        # Write check_events to exit the game.
            # check QUIT option and Q button, to quit an infinity loop.

        # Write update_screen function.
            # Update images on the screen and flip to the new screen.
            # Redraw the screen during each pass through the loop.
            # Draw all raindrops on screen.
            # Make the most recently drawn screen visible.

        # Write get_number_raindrops_x function.
            # Determine the number of raindrops that fit in a row.

        # Write get_nuber_rows fucntion.
            # Determine number of rows of raindrops that fit on the screen.

        # Write create_raindrop function.
            # Create an raindrop and place it in the row.

        # Write create_rain function.
            # Create an raindrop and find the number of raindrops in a row.
            # Spacing between each raindrop is equal to one raindrop.
            # Create the first row of raindrops.
            # Create a raindrop and place it in the row.

        # Write function update_raindrop.
            # Move raindrops down the screen.

# Write game_raindrop.
    # Use instruments such as sys , pygame, Group
        # Write function run_game.
            # Initialize pygame, screen, object, settings.
            # Make a group of raindrops.
            # Create_rain full of blue raindrops.

            # Start the main loop for the game.
                # Watch for keyboard and mouse events.
                # update_raindrop position.
                # Write update_screen function.
        # Play the game.
