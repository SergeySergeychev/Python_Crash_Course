# Ex. 14 -1 , description.
    # Because Alien Invasion uses keyboard input to control the ship, it's
    # best to start the game with a keypress. Add code that lets the player
    # press P to start. It may help to move some code from check_play_button()
    # to a start game() function that can be called from both check_play_button()
    # check_keydown_event().
