    # Modify rw_visual.py by replacing plt.scatter() with
    # plt.plot(). To simulate the path of a pollen grain on an
    # the surface of a drop o a water, pass in the rw.x_values
    # and rw.y_values, and include a linewidth argument. Use
    # 5000 instead of 50000 points.

# Solution:
# import from random choice to generate random numbers.
# import matplotlib.pyplot
    # Create new class WaterDrop.
        # A Class to present a drop of a water on surface.
        # Initialize attributes of a water drop.
        # Starting position on axes is x = 0, y = 0
        # constant attriubte of the class is num_points = 5000

        # Write function
            # fill_trace
                # Keep filling trace until the trace reaches the
                # desired length.
                # Write while loop:
                    # Decide which direction to go and how far to go.
                    # Reject moves that go nowhere.
                    # Calculate the next x and y values.
        # Write function for visualisation.Call file wd_visual.py
            # Import matplotlib
            # import WaterDrop
            # Invoke class WaterDrop as wd
            # call to WaterDrop class function fill_trace
            # Set the size of the plotting window.
            # Write function plot with parameters:
                # x_values, y_values, linewidth = 7
            # Emphasize the first point and last point.
            # Make axes invisible.
            # Show the plot.
