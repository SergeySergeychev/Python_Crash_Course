    Write a class called Employee. The __init__ method should take in
a first name , a last name , and an annual salary, and store each of these
as attribues. Write a method called give_raise() that adds $5000 to the
annual salary by default but allso accepts a different raise amout
    Write a test case for Employee. Write two test methods, test_give_
default_raise() and test_give_custom_raise().Use the setUp method so
you don't have to create a new employee instance in each test method.
run your test case, and make sure both tests pass.
